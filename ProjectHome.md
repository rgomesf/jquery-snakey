A small snake game I made using the excellent jQuery javascript library. It was inspired by the QBasic [Nibbles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbles_(computer_game)) game I used to play a while back as a kid, I remembered about this game the other day and decided to build it in Javascript, with the help of jQuery :)
At first I thought the animation would be sluggish but it turned out pretty responsive.
